**ROUGH DESCRIPTION:**

This is a personal project ** mainly for learning purposes ** but also to put my skills in practice and create a useful tool for my business.

## Description:
  In this project I'm performing data analysis on my business item sales and I'm intergrating them with external features. These features are weather and macroeconomic indicators, as well as location specific features such as holidays or whether the street where my cafe-restaurant is located is pedestrianized or not.
  Following the preparation of the data, I'm training a prediction model in order to predict the sales per category of products 14 days ahead.

## Goal:
  With relatively accurate predictions in hand me and my partners as well as the managers we will be able to make informed decisions regarding to significant aspects of our business such as invetory management, staff scheduling, pricing and others.

## Tools:
  For bringing this project to life, I'm using several resources:
  - APIs: meteostat, FRED, calendarific
  - libraries: such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
  - models: xgboost, lightgbm (as well as others when trying to evaluate which models work best)

## Deliverables:
 - Visual analysis of the data.
 - Executive summary.
 - User interface with intergration of the prediction models, so that the administration of the business can use them as a tool.
  

## Extra:
  Depending on time available, I might perform a marketing simulation as well to see how a marketing change (let's say discount package) would affect sales.
