# Cafe sales forecasting dashboard

**Machine learning-powered dashboard for forecasting category-level product sales using real-world cafe data, external signals (ex. macroeconomic indicators, weather data), and Streamlit interface.**

## Live Demo

Interact with the full dashboard here: [Streamlit Cloud Link]()

Interact with:
- 10-day sales forecasts
- Product category trends
- Main metrics for each category and total predictions
- Simple visuals for Coffee, Non-Coffee Drinks, and Food items

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Forecast Limitations & Usage Notes

This dashboard was built using in a small set of real historical data from my time operating a caf√©, with machine learning models trained on data from `October 1, 2023` up to `November 30, 2024`. Unfortunately, after transitioning to a less involved role in the business the dashboard hasn't been used with live data yet.

You can explore forecasts for future 10 day periods that fall within this **limited testing window**:
> **December 1, 2024 to February 1, 2025**

These dates were chosen because:
- They simulate a realistic future forecasting period
- The models have *not seen this future data*, making it a fair demonstration of performance

Please note: **Entering dates beyond February 1, 2025 will result in no predictions**, as there is no valid feature data beyond that point.

This version is designed as a showcase of modeling + deployment with real world data‚Äînot a live production tool.

## Demo Notebook

Open `forecast.ipynb` to test model predictions on a cleaned, pre-engineered dataset.

It will:
- Load the trained models (`.pkl`)
- Load a future date feature set (Dec 1, 2024 ‚Äì Feb 1, 2025)
- Output forecasted sales per category
- Display graphs + metrics

No training needed.

## Project Summary

This project started during my time operating a caf√©-restaurant in Montr√©al with the goal of predicting sales in key product categories (Coffee, Non-coffee Beverages, Food) to support smarter invetory and prep decisions. It is also a self-improvement challenge.

## Features

- **3 seperate models** (one per product category)
- **10-day forecasts** based on historical trends + external signals
- **API usage** for feature engineering
- **Streamlit dashboard** for non-technical users
- **Modular pipeline** with scripts and reusable functions

## Model performance summary

Each product category has its own ML model, trained and evaluated on historical caf√© data.

MAPE (mean absolute percentage error)
Acc@20 (percentage of predictions falling within 20$ range)
Acc@50 (percentage of predictions falling within 50$ range)
Acc@100 (percentage of predictions falling within 100$ range)


These metrics reflect out-of-sample performance, using a train-test split from the original dataset (up to Nov 30, 2024).

## Tech Stack

- `Python 3.13`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `Ridge`, `GridSearchCV`, `TimeSeriesSplit`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly` for visuals
- `Streamlit` for interactive UI
- `meteostat`, `FRED`, `calendarific` APIs for weather, macroeconomic, holiday data fetching
- `Pickle`, `dill` for model storage

## Potential Improvements

- Add inventory optimization logic based on predicted sales.
- Auto-retraining on new weekly data (current sample size is very small).
- Add LLM-generated report summaries.
- Transition to agentic nature potentially giving alerts and suggestion for invetory management.
